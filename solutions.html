                <h2 class="head2">What skills do you need to be a solution architect?</h2><br>
                <p>Here are some skills solution architects use:
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Technical knowledge</h3><br>
                            A solution architect has to have the technical knowledge and experience to consult on existing IT environments and make recommendations. They use their technical knowledge to assess a current system, identify weaknesses and create additions to systems when required. They need a working knowledge of the construction of hardware and software to provide workable solutions to their clients.
                            <br><br>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Communication skills</h3><br>
                   <p> Solution architects work with clients, which means they are often working with people who may not have the same education in technology as them. They should be able to communicate effectively with their clients so they can understand their assignments and explain what changes need to be implemented. They use their communication skills to explain hard technical concepts to others and create a plan for improvement to which their client can agree.</p><br><br>
                  <h3>  Analytical skills</h3><br>
                   <p> A solution architect uses their analytical skills to observe problems, find their origin and develop workable technological solutions. They identify how different tasks and operations affect each other and how they can alter different layers of business to create a better technological system for a company.</p><br><br>
                  <h3> Project management skills </h3><br>
                  <p> Solution architects usually work with a variety of clients whose systems require multiple solutions. This means they use project management skills to meet various deadlines and keep track of multiple parts of each project. They use organisation and time management to stick to their schedules, set goals and provide direction for how to meet them.</p><br><br>
